title: Analogue API

Welcome to the Analogue API. You can use this public API to access and modify your data on [Analogue](https://analogue.com).

### Examples

We've build our apps on top of this same API:

- [Analogue Alfred Workflow](https://analogue.com/alfred)
- [Analogue Browser Extension](https://analogue.com/extension)

### API Root URL

```bash
https://analogue.com/api/
```

The Analogue API is organized following [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) standards. All requests return properly-formatted [JSON](https://www.json.org/).

### Contact

If you have any issues or questions, or want to submit an example of something you've built with our API, email us at info@analogue.com.
