## What is Analogue?

Analogue is a platform for curating influential content. It's a social database for all your cultural consumption — your books, films, podcasts, albums and articles.# Website

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Hosted on [Render](https://render.com), so commits to `master` automatically deploy.
